### 1. Goals
The goal of the project is to analyze ONT data to identify RNA modified sites (m6a) and
then to fetch a list of genes (IDs?) that those sites are associated with.

### 2. User Input
The user will input (1) ONT RNA BAM file data; (2) a reference genome fasta file; (3) a reference annotation GTF file.
- Why does the user need to input ONT Fasta files if you have the BAM files?

### 3. CODE
The proposal plan for the CLI interface looks nice. It is time to start writing some code. Start with some simple skeleton outlines of the funtions you plan to eventually write. Then start to develop and test each function one at a time to build up to more complex tasks.
